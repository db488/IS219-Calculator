S.O.L.I.D

<b>S : Single Responsibility Principle</b>
```
function Sum(a, b){
    return a+b;
}
```

Here we want to make sure that each function has a single job.  In the Sum() example above, it simply adds two numbers together and then returns the sum.  This is keeping the function from doing more than its sole purpose.
